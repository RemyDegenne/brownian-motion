abstract = {We describe the metaprogramming framework currently used in Lean, an interactive theorem prover based on dependent type theory. This framework extends Lean's object language with an API to some of Lean's internal structures and procedures, and provides ways of reflecting object-level expressions into the metalanguage. We provide evidence to show that our implementation is performant, and that it provides a convenient and flexible way of writing not only small-scale interactive tactics, but also more substantial kinds of automation.},

abstract = {This paper describes mathlib, a community-driven effort to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the Lean proof assistant. Among proof assistant libraries, it is distinguished by its dependently typed foundations, focus on classical mathematics, extensive hierarchy of structures, use of large- and small-scale automation, and distributed organization. We explain the architecture and design decisions of the library and the social organization that has led to its development.},
