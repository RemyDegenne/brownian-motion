# Progressively Measurable σ-algebra

This file defines the progressively measurable σ-algebra associated to a filtration, as well as the
notion of predictable processes. We prove that predictable processes are progressively measurable
and adapted. We also give an equivalent characterization of predictability for discrete processes.

## Main definitions

* `Filtration.rightCont`: The right continuation of a filtration.
* `Filtration.Predictable`: The predictable σ-algebra associated to a filtration.
* `Filtration.IsPredictable`: A process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the
  predictable σ-algebra.

## Main results

* `Filtration.IsPredictable.progMeasurable`: A predictable process is progressively measurable.
* `Filtration.IsPredictable.measurable_succ`: `u` is a discrete predictable process iff
  `u (n + 1)` is `𝓕 n`-measurable and `u 0` is `𝓕 0`-measurable.

## Notation

* Given a filtration `𝓕`, its right continuation is denoted `𝓕₊` (type `₊` with `;_+`).

/-- Given a filtration `𝓕`, its **right continuation** is the filtration `𝓕₊` defined as follows:
- If `i` is isolated on the right, then `𝓕₊ i := 𝓕 i`;
- Otherwise, `𝓕₊ i := ⨅ j > i, 𝓕 j`.
It is sometimes simply defined as `𝓕₊ i := ⨅ j > i, 𝓕 j` when the index type is `ℝ`. In the
general case this is not ideal however. If `i` is maximal for instance, then `𝓕₊ i = ⊤`, which
is inconvenient because `𝓕₊` is not  a `Filtration ι m` anymore. If the index type
is discrete (such as `ℕ`), then we would have `𝓕 = 𝓕₊` (i.e. `𝓕` is right-continuous) only if
`𝓕` is constant. -/
