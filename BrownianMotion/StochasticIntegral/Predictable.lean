# Progressively Measurable σ-algebra

This file defines the progressively measurable σ-algebra associated to a filtration, as well as the
notion of predictable processes. We prove that predictable processes are progressively measurable
and adapted. We also give an equivalent characterization of predictability for discrete processes.

## Main definitions

* `Filtration.rightCont`: The right continuation of a filtration.
* `Filtration.Predictable`: The predictable σ-algebra associated to a filtration.
* `Filtration.IsPredictable`: A process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the
  predictable σ-algebra.

## Main results

* `Filtration.IsPredictable.progMeasurable`: A predictable process is progressively measurable.
* `Filtration.IsPredictable.measurable_succ`: `u` is a discrete predictable process iff
  `u (n + 1)` is `𝓕 n`-measurable and `u 0` is `𝓕 0`-measurable.

## Implementation note

To avoid requiring a `TopologicalSpace` instance on `ι` in the definition of `rightCont`,
we endow `ι` with the order topology `Preorder.topology` inside the definition.
Say you write a statement about `𝓕₊` which does not require a `TopologicalSpace` structure on `ι`,
but you wish to use a statement which requires a topology (such as `rightCont_def`).
Then you can endow `ι` with the order topology by writing
```lean
  letI := Preorder.topology ι
  haveI : OrderTopology ι := ⟨rfl⟩
```

## Notation

* Given a filtration `𝓕`, its right continuation is denoted `𝓕₊` (type `₊` with `;_+`).
