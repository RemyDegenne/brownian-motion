\paragraph{Abstract}

Our goal is to formalize Brownian motions in Lean using \texttt{Mathlib}.
There are two main parts to this formalization:
\begin{itemize}
  \item develop the theory of Gaussian distributions and build a projective family of Gaussian distributions and define its projective limit by the Kolmogorov extension theorem,
  \item prove the Kolmogorov-Chentsov continuity theorem.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notation}

$T$ denotes an index set (for a stochastic process).

$\Omega$ is a measurable space. $\mathbb{P}$ is the probability measure on $\Omega$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the expectation operator with respect to $\mathbb{P}$.

$E, F$ are normed vector spaces. Most often $F$ is a Banach space and $E$ is a Hilbert space.
